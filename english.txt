In the beginning
created
God
-
the heavens
and
the earth
And the earth
was
without form
and void
and darkness
[was] on
the face
of the deep
And the Spirit
God
moved
on
the face
of the waters
And said
God
Let there be
light
and there was
light
and saw
God
-
the light
that
[it was] good
and divided
God
a space between
the light
and between
the darkness
And called
God
the light
Day
and the darkness
he called
Night
And were
the evening
the morning
day
the first
